                Accomplishments (In his own words)
                    •	Commercial Building Project: A project assigned to myself
                      was under extreme budget pressure upon award - with a
                      margin of 0.5%. Through using strategic procurement
                      strategies I managed to procure circa $45,000,000 worth
                      of trades and raise the margin to 4.5% and created a
                      1.5% trade contingency for the project.

                    •	Major Infrastructure Project: I was tasked with the
                      procurement of a mechanical services (HVAC) package, the
                      initial Tender submissions were well in excess of target
                      budget. By developing a procurement strategy and working
                      with all key stakeholders to value manage the design the
                      net result was an overall saving of $10m on the initial
                      Tender pricing.

                    •	Major Resource Project: In February 2009 major flooding
                      of the MESA A in the Western Australis North West project
                      occurred. I was responsible for the contract administration
                      of the project this involved managing the contractors on
                      site to perform works on the fly. I needed to ensure
                      that resources were sourced immediately as requested by
                      the construction manager. I was responsible for data
                      collation of all correspondence (incoming and outgoing)
                      to ensure that Insurance claims (approximately $5million per day)
                      were paid and ensuring all commercial obligations were met
                      by the EPCM in an environment that had not been encountered before.
