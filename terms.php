          <pre>
            1.	Nelgara Pty Ltd (Nelgara) will provide to the
            client the services outlined in the accompanying
            correspondence and such other services as may be
            agreed in writing between Nelgara and the client
            from time to time (together referred to in these
            Terms and Conditions of Engagement as the services)
            on the terms set out in these Terms and Conditions
            of Engagement.

            2.	Nelgara will provide the services in a timely
            manner and with reasonable skill, care and diligence.

            3.	The client will provide Nelgara with all necessary
            briefings, approvals and consents prior to commencing
            the commission to enable Nelgara to provide the services.
            Briefings will include the provision to Nelgara of all
            relevant drawings and other documents and access the client's
            systems and networks.

            4.	The client will allow Nelgara a reasonable time to provide
            the services.

            5.	The client will pay Nelgara the fees set out in the
            accompanying correspondence and all disbursements reasonably
            incurred by Nelgara in providing the services on the terms
            set out in these Conditions. Disbursements will be charged
            in accordance with the schedule of disbursements below.

            6.	The Daily rates of Nelgara stated in the accompanying
            correspondence are subject to escalation. Nelgara reviews
            and adjusts staff salaries to reflect market rates and
            adjusts charge out rates accordingly.

            7.	Where a Nelgara staff/contractor is promoted to a
            higher position the client agrees to pay the higher rate
            for that individual or a Nelgara staff/contractor of
            similar position to the original commission will be allocated.

            8.	Where the client and Nelgara have agreed to perform
            professional services and be remunerated for these services
            under a daily rate arrangement, it is understood by the
            client that the definition of a daily rate consists of
            eight (8) working hours unless otherwise stated in writing
            and agreed by both the client and Nelgara. Any additional
            hours over and above eight (8) hours per day shall be
            payable by the client at the agreed hourly rates pro
            rata the daily rate.

            9.	Agreed rates referred herein mean the hourly rates
            and/or daily rates stated in the accompanying correspondence
            or as otherwise agreed in writing between Nelgara and the client.

            10.	Nelgara will invoice the client every 14 days by tax
            invoice and the client will pay the tax invoice within 14 days
            of receipt. Interest will be charged on overdue invoiced amounts
            at the current WA Supreme Court interest rate.

            11.	The fees in the accompanying correspondence (unless otherwise noted)
            exclude GST. Nelgara fees will attract GST (if confirmed by Nelgara).
            All GST amounts for which Nelgara is liable in respect of the
            provision of the services will be incorporated in the Nelgara
            invoices and will be payable by the client in the same manner and
            at the same time as other amounts payable in accordance with terms
            of these Conditions.

            12.	Where the client is required to reimburse Nelgara for an amount
            Nelgara pays to a third party (e.g. sub-consultants), the amount
            payable by the client (excluding GST) will be subject to an administration
            fee. The third-party cost and administration fee will attract GST.

            13.	Where Nelgara provides a fee estimate, Nelgara does not warrant
            that the services will be provided for the amount of the estimate.
            The actual fee may be less or more than the estimate.

            14.	Where a fixed fee is given, it is based on the scope of work,
            the services to be provided and the timing of the provision of those
            services set out in Nelgara's offer.

            15.	Any variation to the scope of work, the services to be provided
            or the timing of the provision of services required by the client or
            caused by the client will result in a variation to the fee payable
            by the client to Nelgara.

            16.	Any variation to the services to be provided by Nelgara to the
            client will be charged, subject to the terms of these Conditions,
            as to the time charges at the Daily / hourly rates stated in the
            accompanying correspondence or as otherwise agreed in writing between
            Nelgara and the client. In the event that there are no such hourly
            rates, the ACEA. scale of hourly rates will apply. Disbursements
            will be charged for variations in accordance with the schedule of
            disbursements below.

            17.	The liability of Nelgara to the client in respect of the
            project for loss or damage caused to the client by Nelgara will
            be limited to the cost of rectification of the loss or damage or
            $1 whichever is the less. The client will be entitled to
            reimbursement of the amount of such loss or damage by Nelgara
            only if it makes a claim against Nelgara within 6 months of
            completion of the project in respect of which the services are
            provided. Where both the client and Nelgara contribute to the loss
            or damage, the liability of Nelgara to the client in respect of
            that loss or damage will be limited to the extent of the loss or
            damage caused by Nelgara and as set out above.

            18.	The client will indemnify Nelgara against all liabilities,
            costs and expenses which Nelgara incurs
            as a result of any breach by the client of the terms
            of these Conditions.

            19.	Copyright in all documents and electronic material produced
            by Nelgara in connection with the services remains the property
            of Nelgara.

            20.	Subject to Clause 21 of these Conditions, the client alone
            will have a license to use all the documents and material referred
            to in Clause 19 of these Conditions, for the purpose of completing
            the project.

            21.	If the client is in breach of any obligation to make a payment
            to Nelgara, then Nelgara may revoke the license referred to in
            Clause 20 of these Conditions and the client must immediately
            return to Nelgara all the documents and material referred to in
            Clause 19 of these Conditions.

            22.	Subject to Clause 23 of these Conditions, if any dispute
            arises between the client and Nelgara, the party claiming the
            existence of a dispute must set out in writing the issues and
            its contentions in respect of them and must submit that written
            material to the other party within 14 days of the dispute arising.
            The other party must respond in writing within 14 days,
            If this does not resolve the dispute, it will be referred to
            the Chief Executives of each organisation who will meet within a
            further 14 days in an attempt to resolve the issues. If the issues
            are not resolved at that meeting, or within such further time as
            the parties agree, the party claiming the existence of the dispute
            may institute legal action.

            23.	Nothing in these Conditions prevents Nelgara from instituting
            legal action at any time to recover monies owed to it by the client.

            24.	Subject to Clause 26 of these Conditions, the client may
            terminate its obligations under these

            Conditions and the accompanying correspondence:
              a.	In the event of substantial breach by
              Nelgara of its obligations under these Conditions or the
              accompanying correspondence, which breach has not been remedied
              within 30 days of written notice from the client to Nelgara
              requiring the breach to be remedied, or

              b.	Upon the expiration of 60 days written notice from the
              client to Nelgara of its intention to terminate those obligations.

            25.	Subject to Clause 26 of these Conditions, Nelgara may suspend
            or terminate its obligations under these Conditions and the accompanying
            correspondence:

              a.	in the event:

                i.	monies payable to Nelgara under these Conditions are
                outstanding for more than 30 days;

                ii.	there is other substantial breach by the client of its
                obligations under these Conditions or the accompanying correspondence,
                which breach has not been remedied within 30 days of written notice
                to the client from Nelgara requiring the breach
                to be remedied, or

              b.	upon the expiration of 60 days written notice from Nelgara
              to the client of its intention to terminate those obligations.

            26.	Termination under either Clause 24 or 25 of these Conditions
            of obligations under these Conditions and the accompanying
            correspondence or suspension of such obligations under Clause
            
            25 of these Conditions will not affect the rights and obligations
            of the parties existing at the time of the termination or suspension.
            Neither party may assign, transfer or sublet any obligation under
            these Conditions and the accompanying correspondence without the
            written consent of the other. Unless stated in writing to the
            contrary, no assignment, transfer or subletting will release
            the assignor from any obligation under these Conditions or the
            accompanying correspondence.
